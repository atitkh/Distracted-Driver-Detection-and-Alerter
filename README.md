# Distracted Driver Detection and Alerter
This project aims to detect and alert distracted drivers in real-time using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system uses a camera mounted on the dashboard of a vehicle (or upload video file) to capture video of the driver and analyze it for signs of distraction. If the driver is detected to be distracted, an alert is triggered to alert the vehicle owner.
